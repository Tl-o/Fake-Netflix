1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,587
We've been through a lot
to get to this point.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,132
But now, we're finally
on the same page.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,052
We may have settled things
in the Valley,

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,223
but now, we have to be ready
for whatever the world throws at us.

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,315
The Sekai Taikai tournament
is coming.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,609
Now is not the time to puss out.

7
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,278
You'll fight the best in the world.

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,988
Do I wanna know what that's for?

9
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,657
Training, Rocky IV style.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,243
Gonna chop down a tree
and carry it through the snow.

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,245
What could possibly go wrong?

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,123
No matter what life throws at you,

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,501
you gotta stay on your feet.

14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,339
Our strength is
we teach both styles equally.

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,508
Don't jeopardize that balance, man.

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,135
Since when do I run shit by you?

17
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,180
Since we have no idea
what we're up against.

18
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:59,309
Only through pain
does a champion reveal himself.

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,019
Yes, Sensei!

20
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:08,110
One thing is to be the best in town,
another to be the best in the world.

21
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,279
It just means
I'm gonna have to beat Robby again.

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,741
I thought you were Miyagi-Do now.

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,993
You think things are better

24
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,245
because now I'm training
in your dad's backyard?

25
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,872
I think we have our strongest team.

26
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,917
I think they can handle anything.

27
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,503
Bitch, don't you know
I know karate?

28
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,391
What's that?

29
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,103
Miyagi-san buried secrets
for a reason.

30
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,690
If we open, anything is possible.
